          <h3 className="slds-text-heading_small">The Metecho Tool</h3>
          <p>
            Salesforce.org’s Metecho tool is a proprietary web-based tool for
            collaborating on Salesforce projects. The Metecho tool runs on
            Heroku.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Metecho tool will be used for multiple purposes, including, but
            not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating the project team and assigning work;</li>
            <li>
              Provisioning Salesforce scratch orgs for you to do your
              development work in; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Retrieving your development work from the scratch org and
              committing it to the public open source, SFDO-Community-Sprints
              Github repository.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Metecho tool does not access your real production or sandbox
            org, and it does not access any Customer Data as that term is
            defined in the Salesforce Master Subscription Agreement. You do not
            have to use the Metecho tool in order to access the
            SFDO-Community-Sprints Github repository.

            tool, prohibit you from participating in our Open Source Commons or
            other sprints, prohibit you from contributing to our repository, and
            take appropriate legal action.

            Source Community Sprint.
